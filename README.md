## Overview

### CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline automates the following processes:
1. **Building the Application**  
   - Compiling the source code and packaging the application into a deployable format, such as a Docker image.
2. **Testing the Application**  
   - Running automated tests to verify the functionality, stability, and reliability of the application.
3. **Deploying the Application**  
   - Deploying the built application to an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring a seamless transition to the production environment.

### Deployment Target
- The application is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. EC2 provides a scalable and reliable environment for hosting monolithic applications.

## Objectives

The main goals of this project are:
1. **Automate Deployment**  
   Simplify the application delivery process by automating build, test, and deployment tasks using GitLab CI/CD.
   
2. **Enhance Efficiency**  
   Reduce manual intervention and errors by standardizing the pipeline steps.
   
3. **Enable Scalability**  
   Provide a scalable foundation for deploying applications to cloud environments.

4. **Promote Best Practices**  
   Incorporate secure, maintainable, and robust configurations for CI/CD pipelines and cloud deployments.

## Prerequisites

To set up this pipeline, ensure the following:

### AWS EC2 Instance Setup
- An AWS EC2 instance is required for hosting the application.  
- The instance should have Docker installed and configured to run containers.
   ![install docker on ec2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99f4bf27-fde5-4659-be8a-40bca0297793)
  
- The necessary permissions must be assigned to the EC2 instance, allowing it to pull artifacts or images required for deployment.

### GitLab Project Configuration
- A GitLab repository is needed to host the application source code.  
- A GitLab Runner must be registered and linked to the repository to execute the pipeline stages.  
- The runner can be configured on the EC2 instance or a separate machine.

### Secure Credentials Management
- Use GitLab CI/CD variables to securely store sensitive information such as:
  - Docker registry credentials.
  - SSH keys for connecting to the EC2 instance.
  - AWS access keys or IAM roles for accessing cloud resources.

## Key Pipeline Stages

The pipeline consists of the following stages, each playing a crucial role in the development lifecycle:

### 1. Build Stage
- This stage focuses on building the application from the source code.  
- The output is a deployable artifact, such as a packaged binary or a Docker image.  
- The build process ensures compatibility with the target environment.

### 2. Test Stage
- Automated tests are executed to validate the application's functionality.  
- Tests may include unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.  
- This stage ensures that only stable code proceeds to deployment.

### 3. Deploy Stage
- The deploy stage pushes the application to the EC2 instance.  
- It involves pulling the latest version of the application artifact and replacing the running instance with the updated version.  
- This stage can include health checks to verify the success of the deployment.

## How to Set Up the Pipeline

1. **Configure GitLab CI/CD:**
   - Define the pipeline stages and steps in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.  
   - Set up environment variables in the GitLab project settings for secure handling of secrets.

2. **Prepare AWS EC2 Instance:**
   - Ensure the instance is updated and has Docker installed.  
   - Configure security groups to allow access to required ports, such as port 80 for HTTP traffic.

3. **Register GitLab Runner:**
   - Set up a GitLab Runner on the EC2 instance or another machine to execute pipeline jobs.

4. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Push the code to the GitLab repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.  
   - Monitor the pipeline logs to track the progress of each stage.

5. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Test the application on the EC2 instance to confirm that the deployment was successful.

## Best Practices

- **Use Docker for Consistency:**  
  Containerize the application to ensure consistent behavior across development, testing, and production environments.

- **Secure Your Pipeline:**  
  Use GitLab’s built-in features to encrypt sensitive data and manage access control.

- **Implement Rollbacks:**  
  Design the pipeline to allow quick rollback to a previous version in case of deployment failure.

- **Monitor the Application:**  
  Integrate monitoring tools to track the application’s health and performance post-deployment.

- **Automate Cleanup:**  
  Periodically clean up old resources to save costs and prevent clutter.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Deployment Failures
- **Issue:** Network issues or misconfigured environment variables can cause deployment failures.  
- **Solution:** Use clear error logs to debug and ensure proper configuration of secrets and network settings.

### Pipeline Timeouts
- **Issue:** Long-running jobs may exceed pipeline timeout limits.  
- **Solution:** Optimize each stage for efficiency and increase timeout settings if necessary.

### Security Concerns
- **Issue:** Storing sensitive credentials in plaintext increases the risk of leaks.  
- **Solution:** Always use GitLab’s environment variables or secret management tools.
